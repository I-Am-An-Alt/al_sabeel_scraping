## What will I do?

I'll just go the main page to get the list of sections of the encyclopedia and then go through each section page to get the intros, then
will go to each sub-section to get all of the contents.

## The output format?

I will make it as json first, the structure will be as follows:

```json
{
    "section":{
        "intro":"",
        "sub-section": [
            heading,
            image,
            paragraph,
            heading,
            paragraph,
            ...

        ]
    }



}
```
